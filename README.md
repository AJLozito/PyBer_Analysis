The PyBer Project


The Challenge

     The purpose of this project was to identify business opportunities at PyBer (a ride sharing company). To accomplish this goal, data was grouped by city type in order to illustrate trends.
     

The Data Analysis Results

     As the population increases, the number of drivers and fares go up dramatically. The inverse is true when it comes to Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver (see the table above).


The Conclusion Summary

     In order to bring more equilibrium amongst fares, my three recommendations are:
     
1.	Develop a long-term marketing campaign to increase Suburban and Rural ridership

2.	Capitalize on seasonal trends by sending Urban drivers to Suburban and Rural areas during Urban dips during mid to late January and May

3.	Incentivize Urban drivers to pick up more Suburban and Rural riders
